## Why we do this

## Structure

## Workings of the R packages
This would be from a developer perspective, and I do not think that is so interesting for you

# How to develop a new Domain Specific Detadata Scheme

## Background
This is from the perspective of somebody / a group developing a new metadata scheme (domain specific scheme).

## Flowchart
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/workflow_newScheme.png")
```

## Live Demo

# How to use a dmdScheme based Domain Specific Detadata Scheme

## Enter  
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/workflow_enterMetaData.png")
```

## Validate

## Export the entered metadata
This would be from a user / researcher perspective and not require any R knowledge, as a basic GUI (shiny app) is available to do these things. I could obviously also show how to do this from the R prompt, i.e. what the app is doing automatically.

## Live Demo

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
